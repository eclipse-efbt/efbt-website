## Feature Overview

The Cube Links View and Edit interface is a sophisticated visualization and management tool within Eclipse Free BIRD Tools that enables users to create, manage, and visualize relationships between data cubes and their components. This feature provides both tabular and graphical representations of data flow, showing how information moves from source cubes through transformations to target cubes in regulatory reporting frameworks.

## Purpose

Cube Links View and Edit addresses the complexity of modern regulatory data relationships by providing:
- **Visual Data Lineage**: Understand how data flows through your regulatory system
- **Relationship Management**: Create and maintain connections between data cubes
- **Impact Analysis**: Assess the effects of changes on connected systems
- **Network Visualization**: See complex relationships through interactive diagrams
- **Audit Transparency**: Track all cube link modifications for compliance
- **Quality Assurance**: Validate data transformation paths before production

This feature is essential for data architects, compliance officers, and IT professionals who need to maintain transparent, auditable data flows in regulatory reporting environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before using Cube Links View and Edit, ensure:
- Data cubes are properly configured in the system
- You have appropriate viewing and editing permissions
- Source and target cubes contain valid data structures
- Understanding of your organization's data architecture

### Accessing the Interface
Navigate to the FreeBIRD Application and access the Cube Links feature from the main dashboard. The interface provides both tabular views for detailed management and network graphs for visual understanding.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Understanding the Interface

#### Main Control Panel
The interface is organized into several key areas:

**Selection Filters:**
- **Foreign Cube Selector**: Choose the source cube for viewing/editing links (e.g., `F_05_01_REF_FINREP_3_0`)
- **Product Identifier Selector**: Filter cube links by product type (e.g., `Other loans`)

**Action Buttons:**
- **Apply Filters** (Blue): Apply selected criteria to the data grid
- **Reset Filters** (Gray): Clear all filters and return to default view
- **Add New Cube Link** (Green): Create new cube link relationships
- **View Network Graph** (Blue): Display graphical representation
- **Export Diagram** (Purple): Export network diagrams

#### Data Grid Structure
The main grid displays cube link information with these columns:
1. **Maintenance Agency**: Entity responsible for maintaining the link
2. **Cube Link ID**: Unique identifier (format: `ForeignCube::TargetItem`)
3. **Code**: Classification code
4. **Name**: Descriptive name (format: `INSTRUMENT:Description:TARGET`)

### Creating New Cube Links

**Step 1: Initiate Creation**
- Click the **Add New Cube Link** button
- A dialog window opens for configuration

**Step 2: Configure the Link**
- Select source cube from dropdown menu
- Choose source items to connect
- Define target items for mapping
- Specify any transformation rules

**Step 3: Save and Validate**
- Click **Save** to create the link
- The new link appears in the data grid
- Verify the connection through the network graph

### Using Network Graph Visualization

**Understanding Visual Elements:**
- **Source Cube** (Orange cylinder): Originating data cube
- **Source Item** (Blue rectangle): Individual data elements
- **Target Item** (Green diamond): Transformation points
- **Target Cube** (Yellow cylinder): Destination cube
- **Arrows**: Data flow direction

**Navigation Controls:**
- **Pan**: Click and drag the canvas
- **Zoom**: Use mouse wheel or zoom controls
- **Node Details**: Click any node for additional information
- **Close**: Red button to exit visualization

### Filtering and Searching

**Apply Filters:**
1. Select desired Foreign Cube from dropdown
2. Choose Product Identifier if needed
3. Click **Apply Filters** to update the view
4. Use **Reset Filters** to clear selections

**View Filtered Results:**
- The data grid updates to show only matching links
- Network graph reflects the filtered dataset
- Export functions work on filtered data

### Exporting Diagrams

**Export Process:**
1. Open the network graph view
2. Click **Export Diagram** button
3. Choose export format:
   - **PNG**: High-quality images for presentations
   - **SVG**: Scalable graphics for documentation
   - **PDF**: Complete documents with metadata
4. Select destination and save file

## Best Practices

### Data Management
- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names following organizational conventions
- **Regular Validation**: Test links with sample data before production deployment
- **Documentation**: Export key diagrams for reference and training materials
- **Change Control**: Document all modifications with business justification

### Visualization Strategy
- **Start Simple**: Begin with filtered views to understand specific relationships
- **Layer Analysis**: Review each hierarchical level separately for complex mappings
- **Color Coding**: Use visual elements to quickly identify component types
- **Export Library**: Maintain a collection of important relationship diagrams

### Performance Optimization
- **Filter Before Visualizing**: Apply filters before generating large network graphs
- **Batch Operations**: Group related cube link creations for efficiency
- **Regular Maintenance**: Remove obsolete or duplicate links to keep the system clean

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Missing Cube Links:**
- Verify current filter settings are not too restrictive
- Check user permissions for viewing specific cubes
- Refresh the browser page to reload data
- Confirm the source cubes exist and are accessible

**Visualization Problems:**
- Reduce dataset size using filters for better performance
- Check browser compatibility (modern browsers recommended)
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Disable browser extensions that might interfere

**Link Creation Failures:**
- Verify both source and target cubes exist in the system
- Check for duplicate link definitions
- Ensure you have proper editing permissions
- Validate that required fields are completed

**Export Issues:**
- Confirm available disk space on your device
- Check browser download permissions
- Try alternative export formats
- Verify network connectivity for large files

### System Validation
The system automatically performs:
- Circular reference detection and prevention
- Duplicate link identification
- Required field validation
- Data type compatibility checks

## Conclusion

The Cube Links View and Edit feature provides essential capabilities for managing complex data relationships in regulatory environments. Through its combination of detailed tabular views and intuitive network visualizations, it enables both technical and business users to understand, create, and maintain the data lineage critical for accurate regulatory reporting.
