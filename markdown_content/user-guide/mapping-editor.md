## Feature Overview

The Semantic Integration Editor is a sophisticated data transformation tool within Eclipse Free BIRD Tools that enables users to create, manage, and modify complex mappings between source and target data variables. This interface serves as the bridge between various source systems and regulatory reporting structures, facilitating precise data alignment and transformation for compliance purposes.

## Purpose

The Semantic Integration Editor addresses the critical challenge of data transformation in regulatory environments by providing:
- **Semantic Integration Editor**: Map source system data to regulatory reporting requirements
- **Variable Management**: Control both source and target variable definitions

This feature is essential for data engineers, compliance officers, and business analysts who need to ensure accurate data flow from operational systems to regulatory reports while maintaining full transparency and control over transformation processes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before using the Mapping Editor, ensure:
- The import of the relevant data (most likely done in step 1 of the workflow dashboard)
- Knowledge of target regulatory requirements
- Access and understanding to both source and target variable definitions
- Familiarity with the reference terminology used in the BIRD

### Accessing the Semantic Integration Editor
Navigate to the FreeBIRD Application and access the Semantic Integration Editor from the main dashboard. The interface provides comprehensive tools for creating and managing data mapping between frameworks.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Understanding the Interface

The Semantic Integration Editor consists of several key areas:

#### Control Panel Components
- **Select Mapping ID**: Dropdown menu to choose from existing mappings (e.g., `DPM_BAS_MCY_SST_AE_F32.03.b`)
- **Apply Filters**: Filter criteria to focus on specific mapping data
- **Navigation**: Quick access to home, lineage tracking, and review functions

#### Action Buttons
**Row Management:**
- **Add Mapping Row** (Green): Creates new mapping entries
- **Edit Mapping Row** (Green): Modifies existing selected rows
- **Delete Mapping Row** (Red): Removes selected mapping rows

**Mapping Operations:**
- **Duplicate Mapping** (Green): Creates copies of existing mappings

**Variable Management:**
- **Add Target Variable** (Orange): Defines new target variables and members
- **Add Source Variable** (Blue): Adds new source variables and members

### Managing New Mappings

As you can imagine, the mapping editor does not create any mapping, it only edits and duplicate existing mappings.

**Initialize Mapping**
- Select an existing mapping from the **Select Mapping ID** dropdown as a template, or
- Create a new mapping by using **Duplicate Mapping** with a new name
- Choose appropriate naming conventions that reflect the data flow

**Define Source Variables**
- Click **Add Source Variable** to open the variable definition dialog
- Specify variable, member name. Constraints are already defined, given the mapper only gives you a choice to map to data members for now.

**Define Target Variables**
- Click **Add Target Variable** to open the variable definition dialog
- Specify variable, member name. Constraints are already defined, given the mapper only gives you a choice to map to data members for now.

**Create Mapping Rows**
- Click **Add Mapping Row** to establish source-to-target relationships
- Select target data members from available options for all defined variables

**Viewing Mapping Details:**
- Use the dropdown to select specific mappings
- Apply filters to focus on relevant mapping rows
- Review the data grid showing complete source-to-target relationships
- Examine transformation rules and validation logic

**Modifying Mappings:**
- Select specific rows in the data grid
- Click **Edit Mapping Row** to modify transformation rules
- Update variable definitions using the variable management buttons
- Save changes to persist modifications

**Removing Mappings:**
- Select unwanted rows or entire mapping sets
- Use **Delete Mapping Row** to remove selected items
- Confirm deletion to prevent accidental data loss
- Review impact on dependent systems before finalizing

## Best Practices

### Mapping Design
- **Standardize Naming**: Use consistent conventions for mapping IDs and variable names
- **Version Control**: Maintain records of mapping changes and evolution and contribute if your mapping could be used (through the pull Request creation)
- **Regular Cleanup**: Remove obsolete mappings to maintain usability

### Quality Assurance
- **Cross-Reference**: Verify mappings against regulatory documentation
- **Peer Review**: Have mapping logic reviewed by business and technical experts

## Conclusion

The Mapping Editor provides comprehensive capabilities for managing complex data transformations in regulatory environments. By offering both detailed control over individual mappings and powerful batch operations, it enables organizations to maintain accurate, auditable data flows from source systems to regulatory reports while ensuring compliance with evolving requirements.
